# Spring-Boot-Elasticsearch
Spring Boot + Elasticsearch: Build a Fast & Scalable Search API! 

**Project Implementation Steps:** Building a Product Search API with Elasticsearch & Spring Boot
1. **Setting up Elasticsearch**
    - Installed and configured Elasticsearch locally for development and testing.
    - Set up Elasticsearch via Docker for containerized deployment and easy scalability.
    - Verified the Elasticsearch cluster health and connectivity.
2. **Creating an Elasticsearch Index & Model in Spring Boot**
    - Defined the Elasticsearch index to store product data.
    - Created a corresponding model class in Spring Boot, annotated with Elasticsearch mappings for efficient indexing and searching.
    - Configured the Elasticsearch repository for CRUD operations.
3. **Building a REST API for Product Search**
    - Developed RESTful endpoints in Spring Boot to support product search functionality.
    - Integrated Elasticsearch queries to enable full-text search and filtering.
    - Optimized search performance using appropriate indexing and query techniques.
4. **Testing the API using Postman & cURL**
    - Validated the API functionality using Postman for different search scenarios.
    - Executed cURL commands to test API responses and ensure proper request handling.
    - Debugged and optimized the API for accuracy and performance.
